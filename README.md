# SimpleBlockChain
created a very simple blockchain. just for fun. 

# Run: 
```bash
node main.js
```
# What happens? 
basically we create a new blockchain, and later we add two blocks, modify this.difficulty property in order to change the difficulty of mining the block. as for current difficuly level 6, might take a while to get the proof of work.
